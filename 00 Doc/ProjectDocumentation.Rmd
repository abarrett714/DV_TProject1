This project creates visuals from a set of data from natural disasters throughout the United States.

The first Tableau Visualization is a pair of scatter plots that shows both crop damage and property damage versus total time of the disaster. A calculated field was implemented to calculate the total time of the disaster from the begninning and ending time.

The following Code recreates the plot in R using ggplot2 (with the package gridExtra installed):
```{r}
source("../03 Visualizations/workflow-scatterplot(1).R", echo = TRUE)
```

The second Tableau Visualization shows a Crosstab of Regions vs Event Types. The cells are colored by a KPI of Damage over Event Time, employing a paramater to filter out low levels of damage. The KPI creates a metric for intensity of the storm, rather than sum of damage. This makes it easier to compare the severity of the event. A blend was also implemented to assign Regions to each event, allowing for a better understanding of data across the country as a whole.

The following Code recreates the plot in R using ggplot2:
```{r}
source("../01 Data/WorkflowA.R", echo = TRUE)
```

The third Tableau Visualization is two bar graphs that show indirect and direct deaths caused by disasters in the first seven months of 2015. The graphs were colored by property damage in order to show how the number of deaths relates to the overall distruction caused by these disasters. A reference line is also added to show the average deaths for each over the seven month period.
