A calculated field was implemented to calculate the total time of the disaster from the begninning and ending time. \n![](../03 Visualizations/ScatterPlot.jpg)\n\nThe second Tableau Visualization shows a Crosstab of States vs Event Types. The cells are colored by a KPI of Damage over Event Time, employing a paramater to filter out low levels of damage. The KPI creates a metric for intensity of the storm, rather than sum of damage. This makes it easier to compare the severity of the event.\n\n![](../03 Visualizations/Crosstab.jpg)\n\nThe third Tableau Visualization is two bar graphs that show indirect and direct deaths caused by disasters in the first seven months of 2015. The graphs were colored by property damage in order to show how the number of deaths relates to the overall distruction caused by these disasters. A reference line is also added to show the average deaths for each over the seven month period.\n\n![](../03 Visualizations/BarGraph.jpg)\n",
