A calculated field was implemented to calculate the total time of the disaster from the begninning and ending time. \n![](../03 Visualizations/ScatterPlot.jpg)\n\nThe second Tableau Visualization shows a Crosstab of States vs Event Types. The cells are colored by a KPI of Damage over Event Time, employing a paramater to filter out low levels of damage. The KPI creates a metric for intensity of the storm, rather than sum of damage. This makes it easier to compare the severity of the event.\n\n![](../03 Visualizations/Crosstab.jpg)\n![](../03 Visualizations/BarGraph.jpg)\n",
